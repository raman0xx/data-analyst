16. Pipenv
Pipenv is a popular tool used for managing Python dependencies and virtual environments. It provides developers with a simple and efficient way to handle dependencies for their Python projects. It is especially useful for data science projects, often involving working with many different libraries.

Features:
Pipenv manages dependencies for your Python projects, including packages from PyPI and those installed from other sources such as GitHub.
Pipenv creates a virtual environment for your project and installs the necessary packages inside it. This ensures that your project's dependencies are isolated from other Python installations on your system.
Pipenv generates a Pipfile.lock file that records the exact versions of each package installed in your project's virtual environment. This ensures that your project always uses the same dependencies, even if newer versions of those packages are released.
Applications:
Managing dependencies
Streamlining development
Ensuring reproducible results
Simplifying deployment
